NOTE:
A Word About Apprenticeships

Apprenticeships are a fundamental part of Body and Brain.  They are not only templates for starting a character, but they reflect the types of experiences that a character has had over their young life.  This is one area of Body and Brain that we really need your creativity and submissions.  The apprenticeships will be kept in a separate document structure organized by profession to make it easier for players to contribute.
