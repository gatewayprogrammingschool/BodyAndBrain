## Character Creation

### Stats

The first step in generating a Body and Brain character is to make fourteen [D10](#D10) rolls, throw out the low and the high rolls, and sum the remaining rolls, giving you the player stat pool. Next, add the player stat pool to 400 to get your total stat pool. You may only have one stat of 100, one stat of 99, and two stats between 95 to 98. The rest of the stat pool may be allocated freely for stats of 94 and lower. A character may not earn more than 14 skill points per level for either the Body or Brain groups.

#### Selecting a [Profession](#professions)

The next step is to pick a Profession from *[Table 1-1](#table-1-1)*. Using the primary stat group (Body or Brain) as your guide, allocate your stat pool among the Body Stats:

* [Strength](#Strength)
* [Agility](#Agility)
* [Constitution](#Constitution)

and the Brain Stats:

* [Intelligence](#Intelligence)
* [Presence](#Presence)
* [Piety](#Piety)  

###### Table 1-1

|Primary Stat|Profession
|:--|:--
|Presence|[Ranger](#Ranger)
|Presence|[Bard](#Bard)
|Constitution|[Fighter](#Fighter)
|Strength|[Berserker](#Berserker)
|Piety|[Paladin](#Paladin)
|Agility|[Thief](#Thief)
|Intelligence|[Wizard](#Wizard)
|Intelligence|[Conjuror](#Conjuror)
|Piety|[Cleric](#Cleric)

#### Selecting a [Race](#races)

The next step is to pick a Race from the Races available for your chosen profession (See *[Table 1-2](#table-1-2)*). After doing so, you enter the Racial Stat Bonuses for the individual stats (See *[Table 1-3](#table-1-3)*).

###### Table 1-2

|Presence|0|1|2|0|2|0|-1|3
|Piety|0|-2|-3|1|0|2|0|-1

#### Base Bonus

In addition to racial stat bonuses, stats also have an associated base bonus. *[Table 1-4](#table-1-4)* shows the bonus that an individual stat receives based on its value.

###### Table 1-4

|Range|Bonus
|:--|:-:
|1|-5
|2 to 10|-3
|11 to 25|-1
|26 to 49|0
|50 to 75|1
|76 to 89|2
|90 to 94|3
|95 to 98|4
|99|7
|100|10

#### Skills

Skills levels determine your effectiveness at using a specific skill. Skills are
broken down into seven sections:

* [Weapons](#Weapon-Skills)
* [Armor](#Armor-Skills)
* [Physical Skills](#Physical-Skills)
* [Mental Abilities](#Mental-Abilities)
* [Mixed Abilities](#Mixed-Abilities)
* [Arcane Skills](#Arcane-Skills)
* [Other Skills](#Other-Skills)

Skills are developed by spending skill points which are earned each level based on your stats. Using *[Table 1-5](#table-1-5),* assign skill points based on the stat value, keeping in mind that you may not exceed 14 skill points for either the Body or Brain group.

###### Table 1-5

|Range|Skill Points
|:--|--:
|1|0
|2 to 10|0
|11 to 25|0
|26 to 49|0
|50 to 75|1
|76 to 89|2
|90 to 94|3
|95 to 98|4
|99|5
|100|7

#### Weapon Skills

Developing weapon skills is performed by allocating skill points to skill levels. Using *[Table 1-6](#table-1-6)*, a Fighter can spend one skill point for one skill level for their Primary Melee or Primary Missile weapons. A fighter can then spend three skill points for one skill level for their Secondary Melee or Secondary Missile weapons. Our fighterâ€™s Tertiary weapons require spending seven skill points for one skill level.

###### Table 1-6

|Primary Stat|Skill|Fighter|Berserker|Paladin|Ranger|Rogue|Bard|Wizard|Conjuror|Cleric
|:--|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
|Strength|Primary Melee|1/3/7|1/3/7|1/3/7|2/5|2/5|2/5|7|5|2/5
|Agility|Primary Missile|1/3/7|2/5|2/5|1/3/7|2/5|3|5|10|4
|Strength|Secondary Melee|3/7|2/5|3/7|4|6|4|15|15|6
|Agility|Secondary Missile|3/7|4|5|2/5|6|6|10|20|12
|Strength|Tertiary Melee|7|4|7|10|11|12|20|40|10
|Agility|Tertiary Missile|7|9|10|4|11|14|20|40|20

#### Armor Skills

Armor is a bit simpler. The player can allocate skill points to specific armor types same as is done for weapons, but the skill points costs are fixed per armor type. Our fighter can thus allocate the number of skill points denoted in *[Table 1-7](#table-1-7)* for one skill level.

### Character Stats

Body and Brain uses six basic stats that describe a characters attributes that affect gameplay.

#### Body

There are three stats that define the Body category: [Strength](#Strength), [Agility](#Agility) and [Constitution](#Constitution).

##### Strength

Strength is the ability to apply physical force to an object.  Doing things like swinging a sword requires strength to move it.  Strength also is required to wear heavy armor. Marching headlong into battle with heavy weapons, the [Berserker](#Berserker) must be strong to swing those massive weapons with the force to kill their enemies quickly.

##### Agility

Agility is the ability to control your body.  Whether it's fine motor control picking locks, or aiming a bow, Agility allows the character to do these things effortlessly. [Thieves](#Thief) use their Agility in nearly all things they do.

##### Constitution

Constitution is your body's resilience to stresses acting upon it.  The amount of damage you can take before going down and the ability to shoulder heavy loads for long periods of time are determined by a character's Constitution. As the tough guys of the world of Body and Brain, [Fighters](#Fighter) depend greatly on their constitution to wear heavy armor and keep in the fight.

#### Brain

There are three stats that define the Brain category: [Intelligence](#Intelligence), [Presence](#Presence) and [Piety](#Piety).

##### Intelligence

Intelligence is the measure of a character's ability to gain and retain knowledge, and then recall that knowledge and apply it to an action such as casting a spell or reading a scroll during combat.  Of all the classes, [Wizards](#Wizard) and [Sorcerors](#Sorceror) are the most dependent on Intelligence.

##### Presence

Presence is both the character's ability to perceive the world around him and to project himself into that world.  A [Bard](#Bard) depends on his presence to react to others as well as influence them. [Rangers](#Ranger) depend on Presence to help them be aware of their quarry and know when the tables have been turned.

##### Piety

Piety is the connection that a character has to his patron Gods.  [Clerics](#Cleric) and [Paladins](#Paladin) draw upon this Piety to curry favor that is called upon to support the party through healing and calm, as well as to be especially fierce when fighting the [Undead](#Undead).
