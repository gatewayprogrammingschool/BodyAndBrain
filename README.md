# A Simple Role-Playing System

Body and Brain (BaB) is a simple RPG system designed from the ground up to be suitable for both table-top play and computer play. BaB is created for new and experienced gamers alike, offering a slim set of rules that reduces the overhead of the gaming experience; thus, allowing new game masters to acclimate quickly and experienced game masters to keep their campaign moving.

The Body and Brain Roleplaying System is completely open, meaning anyone can participate in the creation, maintenance and extension of the gaming platform.
