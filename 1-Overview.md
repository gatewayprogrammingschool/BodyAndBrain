## Overview

_____

Body and Brain (BaB) is a simple RPG system designed from the ground up to be suitable for both table-top play and computer play. BaB is created for new and experienced gamers alike, offering a slim set of rules that reduces the overhead of the gaming experience; thus, allowing new game masters to acclimate quickly and experienced game masters to keep their campaign moving.

Players of BaB benefit from a simple character sheet requiring little math to set up and get playing. Players get clear and concise instructions for creating, playing and leveling their character.

Creating game modules for BaB is a breeze due to simplified NPC selection and customization. Terrain effects are standardized for physical attack and maneuvers.
