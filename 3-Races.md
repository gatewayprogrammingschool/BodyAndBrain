## Races

_____

Body and Brain is built around normal fantasy races, but that does not mean we need to stop there!  You are encouraged to create and add more races to the Appendices.

### Elf

Elves are the oldest race in Body and Brain, and are practically immortal.  No Elf has ever died of old age and very few have died of disease. Combat and poison, on the other hand, have claimed many Elves over the millennia.

Elves are very intelligent, perceptive and wise.  They have a great presence about them and the more gregarious of them tend to be [Bards](#Bard), with many specializing in [acting](#Acting) while others with a more adventurous side going into [fencing](#Fencing) or [politics](#Politics).

Elves are slight of frame, but are not impeded in the arena of [Strength](#Strength), and are especially agile.  Their combination of [Agility](#Agility), [Presence](#Presence) and [Intelligence](#Intelligence) makes them excellent [Rangers](#Ranger) and [Thieves](#Thief).  [Piety](#Piety) is the Elf's Achilles Heel since they consider themselves akin to the Gods and are not very modest about it, which means that Elves cannot be [Paladins](#Paladin) or [Clerics](#Cleric).

### Human

Humans arose a long time after the [Elves](#Elf).  As their numbers grew, they became jealous of the Elves' long lifespan, and that jealousy led to many wars between the two races.  Humans are more well rounded than Elves, displaying excellent [Strength](#Strength), [Constitution](#Constitution) and [Agility](#Agility), all of which serve them well as the jack-of-all trades in Body and Brain.  Humans can excel at all of the [professions](#3-Professions) equally well.

### Half-Elf

In between the wars between the [Humans](#Humans) and [Elves](#Elves) there were many "encounters" between them.  Humans looking to have children with long lifespans to ensure the longevity of their line began enslaving Elven females and mating with them.  This became such a common practice that there were enough Half-Elves that they started to mate among themselves and eventually forming their own communities.  

Being more well rounded than either Humans or Elves, they found themselves being able to build more balanced armies and thus gaining advantages over both the Humans and the Elves.  Soon they were pushing both out of the lands between the Human and Elven home lands.

### Dwarf

Many ages ago, a race was created by a God of the Mountains that would embrace the God's love of the deep places of the world.  They would have to be adapted well to living in cramped quarters and handling heavy loads.

That race is the Dwarves.  They have very high [Strength](#Strength) and [Constitution](#Constitution), perfect for living underground.  Additionally, they also have a strong connection to their God, making them the fiercest Paladins because of their strong [Piety](#Piety).  Seeing hosts of Dwarven Paladins in full armor is very frightening, whether friend or foe.

#### [Professions](#4-Professions) Available to Dwarves

* [Berserker](#Berserker)
* [Cleric](#Cleric)
* [Fighter](#Fighter)
* [Paladin](#Paladin)

### Halfling

At the same time as creation of the [Dwarves](#Dwarves), another God who loves all things that are beautiful and green created a race that is well suited to the rolling hills and forest that they inhabit.  To aid their ability to live among the trees, they are small, light and very nimble.  Their stature of adults rarely reaching three feet tall has led to their being named Halflings.

Excelling at living among the trees, their [Agility](#Agility) is legendary.  Don't get into a dart throwing contest with a Halfling, you _will_ lose!  Living among the critters of the forest, and also being small, requires an acute sense of your surroundings which drives their excellent [Presence](#Presence) bonus.  Halflings are adept at building homes to their scale that cut into the hills surrounding the nearby forests.  These homes are well camouflaged from outside threats, often being overlooked unless the door is found.  This kind of architecture requires a keen mind, thus explaining their [Intelligence](#Intelligence) bonus.

#### [Professions](#4-Professions) Available to Halflings

* [Bard](#Bard)
* [Cleric](#Cleric)
* [Conjuror](#Conjuror)
* [Ranger](#Ranger)

### Reptilian

Few creatures thrive in lakes, marshes and swamps, so Reptilians are one of two races, along with [Orcs](#Feline) that evolved naturally.  As such they are most well adapted to their surroundings than any other race.  The are capable of very fast bursts of muscle twitch, lending them great [Strength](#Strength), but being cold blooded, their [Agility](#Agility) is less acute than other races.  Their [Constitution](#Constitution) is above average, but they are susceptible to [Cold  Attacks](#Cold).  

Reptilians, being naturally evolved, have a keen sense of their purpose in the world around them.  They are the only race to seek out the meaning of life itself, and that has led them to the highest [Piety](#Piety) as their studious lives have given them insight into all of the Gods and they draw strength from each as necessary, making them excellent [Clerics](#Clerics) and [Paladins](#Paladins).

#### [Professions](#4-Professions) Available to Reptilians

* [Berserker](#Berserker)
* [Cleric](#Cleric)
* [Conjuror](#Conjuror)
* [Fighter](#Fighter)
* [Paladin](#Paladin)
* [Wizard](#Wizard)

### Feline

Intimidation and speed are the best friends of the Feline race.  Felines are also very vain due to their very high [Presence](#Presence), often becoming actors or musicians (and being very good at both).  But on the battlefield they are a force to be reckoned with.  There are no better archers and when in hand to hand combat they can fight with their [Claws](#Claws) as an equivalent to a [Short Sword](#Short Sword).  Their fur is also natural armor, providing them the equivalent to [Soft Leather](#Soft-Leather).  Feline [Bards](#Bard) are capable of wreaking havoc on the battlefield as they joyfully sing [Battle Songs](#Songs) to aid the fight while slashing their opponents.  Felines must develop their claws as their [Primary Melee](#Primary-Melee) weapon, but their bonus stat is [Agility](#Agility) instead of [Strength](#Strength) for that skill.

The trait of the Felines that makes their armies so formidable is that when their Bards sing in unison, it double the area of effect of their spells and doubles any modifier roll for that song. 

#### [Professions](#4-Professions) Available to Felines

* [Bard](#Bard)
* [Conjuror](#Conjuror)
* [Ranger](#Ranger)
* [Thief](#Thief)
* [Wizard](#Wizard)

### Orc

The God who made the [Dwarves](#Dwarves) has an evil little brother who was always jealous of him.  He hated his brother's creation and captured many Dwarves and mutilated and twisted them with dark magic to create Orcs. The Orcs have the most imposing stature, despite their relatively short size (the same as a Dwarf).  The Orcs are immensely strong and sturdy, boasting the highest [Strength](#Strength) and [Constitution](#Constitution).  

During their mutation to Orcs, most of the Dwarves went mad, thus demolishing their ability to think rationally and thus greatly impeding their [Intelligence](#Intelligence), forcing them to rely on their under-developed [Presence](#Presence) to guide their actions, which are usually fool-hardy -- and they are very gullible.  But woe to the individual who makes one mad!  Where the [Felines](#Feline) rule the battlefield as [Bards](#Bard), an Orcish [Berserker](#Berserker) has no equal in hand-to-hand combat, wielding two axes with no penalties.  Additionally, when not wearing armor, Orcs take damage as if wearing [Rigid Leather](#Rigid-Leather) due to their high Constitution.  Finally, Orc Berserkers get a +5 to-hit bonus when when in hand-to-hand combat with a Dwarf.

#### [Professions](#4-Professions) Available to Orcs

* [Berserker](#Berserker)
* [Fighter](#Fighter)
* [Cleric](#Cleric)
