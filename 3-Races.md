## Races

Body and Brain is built around normal fantasy races, but that does not mean we need to stop there!  You are encouraged to create and add more races to the Appendices.

### Elf

Elves are the oldest race in Body and Brain, and are practically immortal.  No Elf has ever died of old age and very few have died of disease. Combat and poison, on the other hand, have claimed many Elves over the millennia.

Elves are very intelligent, perceptive and wise.  They have a great presence about them and the more gregarious of them tend to be [Bards](#Bard), with many specializing in [acting](#Acting) while others with a more adventurous side going into [fencing](#Fencing) or [politics](#Politics).

Elves are slight of frame, but are not impeded in the arena of [Strength](#Strength), and are especially agile.  Their combination of [Agility](#Agility), [Presence](#Presence) and [Intelligence](#Intelligence) makes them excellent [Rangers](#Ranger) and [Thieves](#Thief).  [Piety](#Piety) is the Elf's Achilles Heel since they consider themselves akin to the Gods and are not very modest about it, which means that Elves cannot be [Paladins](#Paladin) or [Clerics](#Cleric).

#### [Professions](#4-Professions) Available to Elves

* [Bard](#Bard)
* [Conjuror](#Conjuror)
* [Ranger](#Ranger)

### Human

Humans arose a long time after the [Elves](#Elf).  As their numbers grew, they became jealous of the Elves' long lifespan, and that jealousy led to many wars between the two races.  Humans are more well rounded than Elves, displaying excellent [Strength](#Strength), [Constitution](#Constitution) and [Piety](#Piety), all of which serve them well as the jack-of-all trades in Body and Brain.  Humans can excel at all of the [professions](#3-Professions) equally well.
